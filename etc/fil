Here's where I am at the end of the first evening:
* you can move around a level. The panning limits are based around the size of the level image and a provided scaling factor, but I'd prefer if we kept it to 1 and just made all our levels 1:1 for now.
* The classes I made are
-Level
-PlayerCharacter
-Entity
-PhysicsAble
-AIable
-GameState
-lots of work on GameplayScreen
All the game update steps are in GameplayScreen

In Gamestate, the integer for adding an entity is a drawing order. lower draws first!
